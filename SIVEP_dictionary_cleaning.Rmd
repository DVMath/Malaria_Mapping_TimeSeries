# SIVEP - Epidemiological Surveillance Information System
This file was done to share details of SIVEP variables and register all dropped variables and modifications we did on kept variables.  
  
## SIVEP time and space resolution  

SIVEP started in 2003 January. We have complete data from 2003 to 2017 and initial months of 2018. The database has entries, permitting to aggregate into **daily case numbers** (reported date in year/month/day) and **epidemiological week**. These can later be aggregated to a different temporal resolution if needed.   

### Spatial resolution  
SIVEP is database for malaria notification that is mandatory in Brazil. Before 2003, the database was named SISMAL, which was a different database in relation to variables and categories.  

Each notification is associated with a federal unity, municipality, zone type (urban/rural) and a locality, which gives a finer resolution. Localities might be on the size of census tract or, more generally, smaller. Information from localities can be linked to IBGE census. SIVEP database has a complementary databe with localities information. This information will be listed below.

## Confirmation of malaria cases
Cases in Brazil are mostly confirmed by microscopy. The detection is of three types: passive, active and LVC (Cure Verification Thick Smear). **Passive case detection** corresponds to a diagnosis done when an individual looks for health assistance. **Active case detection** corresponds to a diagnosis done by a screening after finding a case. The protocol is described as an active search, when a case is reported, such that the neighboorhood around 1 km radius is investigated. LVC cases are notifications done when individuals return to health units. We still need to investigate more about numbers of LVC cases.  

## Treatment data     
SIVEP provides the **treatment schema for reported cases**. Completeness is > 85% and after 2011, > 95%. We have just requested more information about it, because is in a complementary database.

- **FALCIPARUM**: informs if the patient received treatment for falciparum malaria in the last 40 days prior to notification.


- Loading RData file 
```{r}
library(foreign)
library('stringr')
library("tidyverse")
library(lubridate)

load("RData_full.RData")

```

### Removing variables  
**Obs.**: RES_EXAM = 0 happens only in 2003 in 17 entries. I removed because this category does not exist.  
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
      select(-DT_ENVLO, -DT_DIGIT, -SEM_NOTI, -COD_UNIN, -COD_AGEN, -RACA, -GESTANTE1, -NIV_ESCO_1, -ESQUEMA_1, -ESQUEMA, -HEMOPARASI, -EXAME_, -EXAMINADOR, -VIVAX, -FALCIPARUM) %>% 
      filter(RES_EXAM == "2" | RES_EXAM == "3" | RES_EXAM == "4" | RES_EXAM == "5" | RES_EXAM == "6" | RES_EXAM == "7" | RES_EXAM == "9")

```

### Filtering and grouping to falciparum and vivax types.
RES_EXAM categories:  
2 - Falciparum    
3 - F+FG    
4 - Vivax    
5 - F+V  
6 - V+FG   
7 - FG    
8 - Malariae    
9 - F+M    
10 – Ovale    
11 – Não F
